The `.ipynb` notebook here demonstrates how to leverage transfer learning to use your own image dataset to build and train an image classification model using MXNet and Amazon SageMaker. 

We use, as an example, the creation of a trash classification model which, given some image, classifies it into one of three classes: Compost, Landfill, Recycle. This is based on the [Show Before You Throw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut1VGG6TOOw) project from an AWS DeepLens hackathon.
